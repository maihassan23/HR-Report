# HR-Report
Power BI dashboard created during the Egypt Data Builders Bootcamp with Eng.Ali Ashraf. 
I built an HR dashboard, and I’d like to share some insights based on the data. Let’s take a look at what these numbers say:
_Headcount and Gender Distribution: 
The total headcount is 157, with 56% females and 44% males. This distribution is fairly balanced, but there are opportunities to enhance gender diversity in leadership roles. 
_Performance Ratings:
 Women have higher average performance ratings than men, suggesting greater productivity or engagement among female employees. 
_Age and Tenure:
 The average age is 38, with many employees aged 30-39. An average tenure of 8.3 years indicates stability but may lead to skills stagnation.
_Training and Performance:
 More training hours correlate with better performance and salary increases. Encouraging greater participation in training could boost overall productivity.
_Attrition Rates:
 Attrition decreases with higher performance ratings, indicating that high performers tend to stay. However, increased overtime, especially in IT, suggests potential burnout. 
_Leavers vs. Hires in 2023:
The trend of more leavers than hires in 2023 needs investigation to understand job satisfaction and company culture.
_Marketing Department Age Distribution:
The marketing team is mainly aged 40-49, which may limit innovation if younger perspectives are not included. 
Recommendations:
1. Enhance Gender Diversity: Promote women in leadership through mentorship and targeted recruitment. 
2. Focus on Training: Increase investment in training for lower-performing employees with flexible options.
 3. Address Overtime: Investigate workload in IT and consider hiring or redistributing tasks.
 4. Conduct Employee Surveys: Gather feedback on job satisfaction and reasons for leaving.
 5. Develop Retention Strategies: Tailor strategies for high performers with advancement and recognition opportunities.
 6. Diversify Marketing: Recruit younger talent to improve creativity and adaptability. 
7. Monitor Key Metrics: Continuously track attrition rates and training participation to respond proactively.
